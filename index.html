      conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not

      our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
      know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
      you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
      of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
      you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
      says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
      tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
